# Front End Development Final Project
## Intro
This is a prototype web app for a company called EventEase. The app allows users to view a list of events and register for events. It also allows event hosts to keep track of attendance. The app was build using BlazorWebassembly, and features intuitive navigation along with modular components to allow for the adding of more features later on.

```
2. Then run the app:
```

3. Access the app in your browser using the specified url the terminal provides once the app is running.

## Copilot Assistance
- Helped create the EventCard component, which is used to store details about the event and is used to display a list of all events on the /events page.
- Helped implement input validation for Registration.
- Suggested the creation of a service to track the current user and a service to track the number of attendees for a given event.
- Caught an error that was causing the /register page to not load.
